Homing-bird is a convenience wrapper to create an erlang-esque messaging
queue for python. It uses zeromq as its messaging backend.

1.) Install zeromq from www.zeromq.org and pyzmq from https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq
2.) Run python setup.py install

USAGE:
#create a thread that calls a function when a message is received
>>> from homingbird import Node, LocalNode
>>> def echo(msg):
...     msg.reply(msg.data)
...
>>> l = LocalNode()
>>> r = Node(echo)
>>> l.send(r, "Hi there")
>>> print l.receive().data
Hi there

The API is still very much in flux. Still to come: supervisors, JSONNodes, exceptions
